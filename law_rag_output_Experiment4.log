Answer: 
Yes, you are eligible for Jobseeker Support if you can't work due to health reasons.

Reasoning: 
According to Section 141(1), a beneficiary is considered to have the capacity to seek, undertake, and be available for part-time work if they do not have a determination under that section that they do not have such capacity. Since there's no indication that you've been deemed incapable of working due to your health conditions, you should be eligible for Jobseeker Support. However, it's worth noting that the decision to grant or deny Jobseeker Support is ultimately at the discretion of the Medical Board, as stated in Section 141(1).
