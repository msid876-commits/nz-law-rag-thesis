Context:
[SSA 2018, Section 4]: If subsections (2) and (3) are to be, or have been, relied on to exercise a power,— all other enactments relevant to the power’s exercise, and that have not yet commenced, must be treated as if they had commenced; and a legal position that would be conferred or imposed by an enactment relevant to the power’s exercise, and that has not yet commenced, must be treated as if it has accrued or been imposed. Principles Every person performing or exercising a duty, function, or power under this Act must have regard to the following general principles: work in paid employment offers the best opportunity for people to achieve social and economic well-being: the priority for people of working age should be to find and retain work: people for whom work may not currently be an appropriate outcome should be assisted to prepare for work in the future and develop employment-focused skills: people for whom work is not appropriate should be supported in accordance with this Act. [Part 4](#part4) contains provisions on factors affecting benefits (for example, jobseeker profiles, insurance, entitlement to overseas pensions, shared care of a dependent child, hospitalisation, being in custody in prison or on remand, and absence from New Zealand—_see_ the guide in [section 183](#part4-subpart1-s183)). A direction under this section is secondary legislation (_see_ Part 3 of the Legislation Act 2019 for publication requirements). MSD may make a determination to regard as a party to a de facto relationship, for the purposes of the decision, any 2 people who, not being legally married or in a civil union, have entered into a de facto relationship. Subsection (3) is subject to subsections (5) and (6) and [section 11](#part1-s11). This section does not limit [section 204](#part4-subpart2-s204) (MSD may refuse or cancel benefit if person not ordinarily resident in New Zealand), and is subject to [section 205](#part4-subpart2-s205) (refugee or protected person status). P is eligible under this subsection, during the period between the end of one academic year and the start of the next, if P is a full-time student who is aged 16 or 17 years and MSD is satisfied that— P has a parental support gap (as defined in [section 52(1)﻿(a), (b), or (c)](#part2-subpart7-s52), but not as defined in section 52(1)﻿(d)); or P is in a relationship. In this section, ==child== means a dependent child of the parents— born of their relationship; or adopted by the parents, or by 1 of the parents, during their relationship. Obligations or exemptions that apply to P immediately before the expiry of P’s sole parent support continue after that expiry in respect of the jobseeker support to which P is transferred under subsection (2) if those obligations or exemptions are any of the following: the obligation to work with contracted service providers: work-preparation obligations: social obligations of certain assistance recipients with dependent children: the obligation to undergo a work ability assessment: work-test obligations: an exemption from work-test obligations or from obligations to prepare for employment (other than any exemption that, under regulations made under [section 431](#part8-s431), is not available to a person receiving jobseeker support). The prescribed health practitioner must prepare, and must send MSD a copy of, a report that indicates— whether P is (or whether there is doubt about whether P is)— permanently and severely restricted in P’s capacity for work; or totally blind; and the grounds on which the opinion given in paragraph (a) is based. P does not lose P’s entitlement to a supported living payment by reason only of working 15 or more hours a week in open employment during the agreed period. Supported living payment: on ground of caring for another person: requirements A person (==C==) is entitled to the supported living payment if— MSD is satisfied that C is required to give full-time care and attention at home to a person (==P==) who would otherwise have to receive institutional care (and who is not C’s spouse or partner); and C meets the residential requirement; and C is aged— at least 18 years, in the case of an applicant without a dependent child; or at least 20 years, in any other case. MSD may continue a payment granted under this section for a period of not more than 28 days even though P was not during that period in the full-time care of C. In this subpart, ==institutional care== means care that is, or is equivalent to,— hospital care, rest home care, or residential disability care, as defined in section 4(1) of the Health and Disability Services (Safety) Act 2001; or care of the kind referred to in section 141 of the Oranga Tamariki Act 1989 (which relates to care of severely disabled children and young persons). Supported living payment: on ground of caring for another person: application must include certificate A person (==C==) who applies for a supported living payment on the ground of caring for another person (==P==) must include in the application a certificate that complies with this section. The certificate must be given by a prescribed health practitioner and must certify— that P requires C’s full-time care and attention; and that, were it not for that care and attention, P would have to receive institutional care. Supported living payment: on ground of caring for another person: medical examination When considering an application for, or reviewing under [subpart 3](#part6-subpart3) of Part 6, a supported living payment on the ground of caring for another person, MSD may require that the person being cared for be examined by a prescribed health practitioner nominated for the purpose by MSD. A prescribed health practitioner nominated under subsection (1) must assess whether the person would, were it not for the applicant’s full-time care and attention, have to receive institutional care. Orphan’s benefit: requirements This section applies if, because of the circumstances specified in subsection (2), a child has no parent (as defined in subsection (3)) who is able to care for the child. The circumstances are that each of the child’s parents (as defined in subsection (3))— is dead; or is missing; or has a long-term serious disablement. A ==parent==, in relation to a child, and for the purposes only of this subpart and [section 31(b)﻿(i)](#part2-subpart3-s31), means a natural parent or an adoptive parent (and so excludes, for those purposes, a step-parent) of the child. A person (==P==) is entitled to an orphan’s benefit for the child if— P is an eligible caregiver of the child; and either— the child is both resident and present in New Zealand; or P has been both resident and present in New Zealand for a continuous period of 12 months at any time. Who is eligible caregiver A person (==P==) is an eligible caregiver of a child if— P is aged 18 years or over; and P is not a parent (as defined in [section 43(3)](#part2-subpart5-s43)) of the child; and the child is a dependent child of P; and P is a principal caregiver or principal temporary caregiver of the child. _[Repealed]_ Orphan’s benefit to be used for benefit of child The purpose of the orphan’s benefit is to provide financial support for the cost of caring for a child who is not the caregiver’s own. A caregiver who is granted an orphan’s benefit must use the benefit for the benefit of the child in respect of whom it was granted, including the child’s maintenance and education. Unsupported child’s benefit: requirements This section applies if, because of the circumstances specified in subsection (2), a child has no parent (as defined in subsection (3)) who is able to— care for the child; or provide fully for the child’s support. The circumstances are that there has been a breakdown in the child’s family. A ==parent==, in relation to a child, and for the purposes only of this subpart and [section 31(b)﻿(ii)](#part2-subpart3-s31), means a natural parent, an adoptive parent, or a step-parent of the child. A person (==P==) is entitled to an unsupported child’s benefit for the child if— P is an eligible caregiver of the child; and either— the child is both resident and present in New Zealand; or P has been both resident and present in New Zealand for a continuous period of 12 months at any time. Who is eligible caregiver A person (==P==) is an eligible caregiver of a child if— P is aged 18 years or over; and P is not a parent (as defined in [section 46(3)](#part2-subpart6-s46)) of the child; and the child is a dependent child of P; and P is a principal caregiver or principal temporary caregiver of the child. _[Repealed]_ Unsupported child’s benefit to be used for benefit of child The purpose of the unsupported child’s benefit is to provide financial support for the cost of caring for a child who is not the caregiver’s own. A caregiver who is granted an unsupported child’s benefit must use the benefit for the benefit of the child in respect of whom it was granted, including the child’s maintenance and education. Youth payment: requirements A person (==P==) is entitled to a youth payment if— P is aged 16 or 17 years; and P is study ready; and P has no dependent children; and P meets the residential requirement; and P has no or minimum income; and either— P has never been in a relationship and has a parental support gap; or P is or has been in a relationship, but is not currently in a relationship with a specified beneficiary. If subsections (2) and (3) both apply to P, P’s youth payment continues until the later of the 2 dates that apply under those subsections. If subsections (2) and (3) both apply to P, P’s young parent payment continues until the later of the 2 dates that apply under those subsections. However, the rate of an emergency benefit must not exceed the rate of the ==equivalent benefit==, that is, the main benefit under this Act (other than an emergency benefit) that MSD would grant to a person entitled to the benefit in circumstances similar to P’s. This section overrides every other provision of this Act. This section does not limit MSD’s discretion to refuse to grant, to reduce the rate of, or to cancel an accommodation supplement in accordance with the other provisions of this Act. Unless it is revoked, the election stops the person from being entitled to the payment for any days after the election is made. An instalment must be paid on the relevant payment date. In this section, ==health practitioner==— has the same meaning as in section 5(1) of the Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act 2003; and includes a person who is receiving training or gaining experience under the supervision of a health practitioner. This section is subject to [section 94](#part2-subpart15-s94) (restrictions on payments). This section is subject to [clause 20](#sch3-part5-s20) (how commitments for temporary additional support may be affected by debt, or health or disability, insurance payment) of Schedule 3. The Minister must not give the notice except on, and after considering, the written recommendation of the chief executive of the Ministry of Health. The Crown may incur, without further appropriation than this subsection, expenses or capital expenditure for the purpose of providing special assistance under this section. A notice under this section is secondary legislation (_see_ Part 3 of the Legislation Act 2019 for publication requirements). This section does not apply to a beneficiary who is unable to provide satisfactory evidence of the beneficiary’s tax file number within the deadline or extended deadline specified because of any health condition, injury, or disability. Subsection (1) is satisfied for a change in a beneficiary’s circumstances that is an information share child support payment made to a beneficiary if the payment is disclosed to MSD under a specified approved information sharing agreement. The consequence of a determination under subsection (1) that the person has, while receiving that benefit, the capacity to seek, undertake, and be available for part-time work is that the person is required to comply with the work test on and after a date

[SSA 2018 – Part 2, Subpart 2, Section 27]: Jobseeker support: on ground of health condition, injury, or disability: application must include certificate An applicant (==A==) for jobseeker support on the ground of health condition, injury, or disability must include in the application a certificate that complies with this section. The certificate must be given by a prescribed health practitioner. The certificate must— certify that A’s capacity for work is affected by health condition, injury, or disability; and indicate the nature of the health condition, injury, or disability, the extent to which A’s capacity for work is affected by it, and the length of time that effect is likely to last; and contain any other information that MSD may require. Sanction for first or second failure: suspension of in-hand allowance and incentive payments This section applies if MSD is satisfied that a young person (==P==) who is receiving a youth payment has, without good and sufficient reason, failed to comply with a young person obligation for a first or second time. For P’s first or second failure, MSD must first suspend P’s in-hand allowance and any incentive payments until P satisfies the obligation (or all the relevant obligations, if P has failed to comply with more than 1). If P has not satisfied the obligation or obligations within 4 weeks after the suspension takes effect, MSD must suspend the whole of P’s youth payment and any incentive payments until P satisfies the obligation or obligations. Cancellation of youth payment and incentive payments for continuing failure to comply MSD must cancel a young person’s (**P’s**) youth payment and incentive payments if— MSD has, under [section 270](#part5-subpart3-s270), imposed a sanction described in section 270(2) on P; and P fails to recomply, within 13 weeks after the sanction takes effect, with each obligation— for which the sanction was imposed for a failure to comply with; and that P has not ceased to have; and [section 320](#part6-subpart4-s320) does not apply to P. On cancellation under this section of P’s youth payment,— MSD must also cancel the following benefits if P is receiving them: accommodation supplement: temporary additional support: disability allowance (but not child disability allowance); but that cancellation of those benefits does not, if P reapplies for all or any of them, affect or limit P’s entitlement to all or any of them. On cancellation under this section of P’s youth payment, to be again entitled to youth payment under this Act, P must apply for youth payment and establish that P is eligible for youth payment. If P is again entitled to youth payment under this Act, to be entitled again to incentive payments, P must satisfy the criteria for incentive payments (as those criteria are prescribed for the purposes of [section 55](#part2-subpart7-s55) by regulations made under [section 418(1)﻿(c)](#part8-s418)). Sanction for third failure: cancellation of youth payment and incentive payments This section applies if MSD is satisfied that a young person (==P==) who is receiving a youth payment has, without good and sufficient reason, failed to comply with a young person obligation for a third time. For P’s third failure, MSD must cancel P’s youth payment and any incentive payments. On cancellation of P’s youth payment under this section,— P is not entitled to receive any main benefit under this Act for 13 weeks from the date of cancellation; and to be again entitled to a main benefit under this Act, P must apply for the benefit and establish that P is eligible for it. This section is subject to [sections 320 to 324](#part6-subpart4-s320). For the purposes of [section 320](#part6-subpart4-s320), an approved activity for P during the period of non-entitlement is any of the following approved by MSD: if P is not already in part-time work, participation in part-time work or work experience: participation in recognised voluntary work (as defined in [Schedule 2](#sch2)): participation in any other activity that MSD considers will enhance skills or improve motivation. This section overrides every other provision of this Act. Effect of cancellation of youth payment on accommodation supplement or temporary additional support The cancellation under [section 271(2)](#part5-subpart3-s271) of the youth payment payable to a young person (==P==) has the effect set out in subsections (2) to (4). If P is single, P is not entitled to receive an accommodation supplement or temporary additional support. If P is not single, and P’s spouse’s or partner’s youth payment is not also cancelled under [section 271(2)](#part5-subpart3-s271),— the rate of any accommodation supplement or temporary additional support otherwise payable to P must be reduced by half and be paid to P’s spouse or partner; and the rate of any accommodation supplement or temporary additional support otherwise payable to P’s spouse or partner must be reduced by half. If P is not single, and the youth payment of P’s spouse or partner is also cancelled under [section 271(2)](#part5-subpart3-s271),— P is not entitled to receive an accommodation supplement or temporary additional support otherwise payable to P; and P’s spouse or partner is not entitled to receive an accommodation supplement or temporary additional support payable to P’s spouse or partner. Effect of cancellation of youth payment on emergency benefit A young person whose youth payment is cancelled under [section 271(2)](#part5-subpart3-s271) is not entitled to receive an emergency benefit. Effect of cancellation of youth payment on disability allowance or child disability allowance Despite the cancellation under [section 271(2)](#part5-subpart3-s271) of the youth payment payable to a young person (==P==), P must be treated as continuing to receive a youth payment for the purposes of [section 85(1)﻿(a) and (2)﻿(c)﻿(i)](#part2-subpart14-s85) and the cancellation has no effect on P’s entitlement to receive a disability allowance or child disability allowance. Sanctions for failure by young person required to receive youth services to comply with obligations: youth money management This section applies to a young person— who has been required to receive youth services under [section 165(2)](#part3-subpart3-s165)  or [168(2)](#part3-subpart3-s168); and whose benefit is subject to youth money management under [section 344](#part6-subpart5-s344); and who MSD is satisfied has, without good and sufficient reason, failed to comply with an obligation that applies to the young person under [section 165(7)﻿(a)](#part3-subpart3-s165)  or [168(6)﻿(a)](#part3-subpart3-s168), and that is— an obligation in [section 166(2)﻿(b) and (d) to (g)](#part3-subpart3-s166); or the work test (in the case of a work-tested beneficiary); or a work-preparation obligation under [section 124](#part3-subpart3-s124)  or [125](#part3-subpart3-s125) (in the case of a beneficiary who is required to comply with section 124). MSD must treat the failure as if it were a failure to comply with an obligation under [section 166](#part3-subpart3-s166), and [sections 270](#part5-subpart3-s270)  and [271](#part5-subpart3-s271) apply (and require MSD to impose sanctions for the failure) accordingly. Sanctions for failure by young person required to receive youth services to comply with obligations: other cases This section applies to a young person— who has been required to receive youth services under [section 165(2)](#part3-subpart3-s165)  or [168(2)](#part3-subpart3-s168); and whose benefit is not subject to youth money management under [section 344](#part6-subpart5-s344); and who MSD is satisfied has, without good and sufficient reason, failed to comply with an obligation that applies to the young person under [section 165(7)﻿(a)](#part3-subpart3-s165)  or [168(6)﻿(a)](#part3-subpart3-s168), and that is— an obligation in [section 166(2)﻿(b) and (d) to (g)](#part3-subpart3-s166); or the work test (in the case of a work-tested beneficiary); or a work-preparation obligation under [section 124](#part3-subpart3-s124)  or [125](#part3-subpart3-s125) (in the case of a beneficiary who is required to comply with section 124). MSD must treat the young person’s failure referred to in subsection (1)﻿(c)﻿(i), (ii), or (iii),— in the case of a young person who is subject to the work test, as a failure to comply with the work test for the purposes of [sections 233](#part5-subpart2-s233)  and [236 to 239](#part5-subpart2-s236); and in the case of a young person who is required to comply with section 124, as a failure to comply with a work-preparation obligation under [section 124](#part3-subpart3-s124)  or [125](#part3-subpart3-s125) for the purposes of [sections 233](#part5-subpart2-s233)  and [236 to 239](#part5-subpart2-s236). MSD must, in the case of a young person who is subject to a sanction under [sections 233](#part5-subpart2-s233)  and [236 to 239](#part5-subpart2-s236) for a failure that subsection (2)﻿(a) or (b) of this section requires to be treated as having occurred: suspend the young person’s incentive payments (if any) (if that sanction is a reduction in the rate of or suspension of the young person’s benefit) until the young person recomplies; or cancel the young person’s incentive payments (if any) (if that sanction is the cancellation of the young person’s benefit). [Section 232(3)](#part5-subpart2-s232) prevents MSD from imposing under section 232 a non-financial sanction on a young person to whom subsection (2)﻿(a) or (b) of this section applies. Sanctions for failure by young spouse or partner of specified beneficiary to comply with obligations: youth money management This section applies to a young person— who is— aged 16 or 17 years, without dependent children, and is the spouse or partner of a specified beneficiary; or aged 16 to 19 years, with a dependent child or children, and is the spouse or partner of a specified beneficiary; and whose benefit is subject to youth money management; and who MSD is satisfied has, without good and sufficient reason, failed to comply with an obligation that applies to the young person under [section 166(2)](#part3-subpart3-s166)  or [167(2) and (3)](#part3-subpart3-s167). The sanctions in [sections 270](#part5-subpart3-s270)  and [271](#part5-subpart3-s271) apply (and [sections 272 to 274](#part5-subpart3-s272)  and [283 to 288](#part5-subpart3-s283) apply) as if the young person’s benefit were a youth support payment. Sanctions for failure by young spouse or partner of specified beneficiary to comply with obligations: other cases This section applies to a young person— who is— aged 16 or 17 years, without dependent children, and is the spouse or partner of a specified beneficiary; or aged 16 to 19 years, with a dependent child or children, and is the spouse or partner of a specified beneficiary; and whose benefit is not subject to youth money management; and who MSD is satisfied has, without good and sufficient reason, failed to comply with an obligation that applies to the young person under [section 166(2)](#part3-subpart3-s166)  or [167(2) and (3)](#part3-subpart3-s167). MSD must treat the young person’s failure referred to in subsection (1)﻿(c),— in the case of a young person who would, but for [section 166(4)](#part3-subpart3-s166)  or [167(5)](#part3-subpart3-s167), be subject to the work test, as a failure to comply with the work test for the purposes of [sections 233](#part5-subpart2-s233)  and [236 to 239](#part5-subpart2-s236); and in the case of a young person who would, but for [section 166(4)](#part3-subpart3-s166)  or [167(5)](#part3-subpart3-s167), be required to comply with section 124, as a failure to comply with a work-preparation obligation under [section 124](#part3-subpart3-s124)  or [125](#part3-subpart3-s125) for the purposes of [sections 233](#part5-subpart2-s233)  and [236 to 239](#part5-subpart2-s236). MSD must, in the case of a young person who is subject to a sanction under [sections 233](#part5-subpart2-s233)  and [236 to 239](#part5-subpart2-s236) for a failure that subsection (2)﻿(a) or (b) of this section requires to be treated as having occurred,— suspend the young person’s incentive payments (if any) (if that sanction is a reduction in the rate of or suspension of the young person’s benefit) until the young person recomplies; or cancel the young person’s incentive payments (if any) (if that sanction is the cancellation of the young person’s benefit). [Section 232(3)](#part5-subpart2-s232) prevents MSD from imposing under section 232 a non-financial sanction on a young person to whom subsection (2)﻿(a) or (b) of this section applies. Sanction for failure to comply with young parent obligation The sanction for failure to comply with a young parent obligation depends on whether the failure is a first or second failure or a third failure. Obligations exemption regulations Regulations made under section 123D of the Social Security Act 1964 are saved as if they were made under [section 431(1)﻿(e)](#part8-s431).

Final Answer:...

The final answer is: 
You are eligible for Jobseeker Support if you can't work due to health reasons.

Reasoning: 
To determine eligibility, we need to look at section 27 of the SSA 2018, which states that applicants for Jobseeker Support on the ground of health condition, injury, or disability must include a certificate from a prescribed health practitioner. The certificate must certify that the applicant's capacity for work is affected by the health condition, injury, or disability, and provide details about the nature of the condition, its impact on the applicant's capacity for work, and the expected duration of the effect.
